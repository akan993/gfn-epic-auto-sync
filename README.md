   Press `F12` (or `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Opt+I` on Mac) and switch to the **Console** tab.

   https://play.geforcenow.com/

2. Wait until the entire UI has loaded.

3. Open Developer Console (`F12` ‚Üí **Console** tab).

4. Paste this first (replace with your list):

   ```js
   const gameTitles = [
     "Fortnite",
     "Alan Wake Remastered",
     "Control"
   ];
   ```

5. Then paste and run the contents of `main.js`.

6. Finally, start the script:

   ```js
   gfn.run();
   ```

## ‚úã How to Stop the Script

You can stop the automation at any point by pressing:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Some games may **not match** exactly between Epic and GeForce NOW (e.g., editions, renamed titles). These will be skipped.
- The script uses **hard-coded DOM selectors** ‚Äî if the UI changes, you may need to update the script.
- It's intended for **desktop browser use** with sufficient screen resolution and loading speed.
- This is a user-side utility, not affiliated with Epic Games or NVIDIA.
